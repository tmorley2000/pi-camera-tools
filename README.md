## framing-focus-tool.py

Based on mjpeg streaming demo, runs a webserver on :8000 and streams a low resultion full frame to help framing, and full resolution crops from the corners and center of the image to allow fine focus adjustment.

Memory limits stop this working on a pi-zero with an pi-hq-camera.
